## About this Repository

Data collection allows teachers to monitor student progress and adjust the
curriculum accordingly. K-12 teachers often do not have the time to create the
tools necessary for proper data collection. This repository is the codebase for
a series of programatically generated assessments designed with long-term data
collection in mind. The goal is to make the process of data collection as easy
as possible, increasing the probability that teachers will be able to implement
these strategies. 

# Assessments in this Collection

## CVC Words

Consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) words are an early reading skill. We use Python
to generate 20 random samples of 20 words each from a large list of common CVC
words. Each sample of 20 contains four words containing each short vowel sound.
The sample size of 20 allows for quick mental calculation of the accuracy as a
percentage, and a data table and blank graph are provided for tracking accuracy
over time.
