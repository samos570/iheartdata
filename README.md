## About this Repository

Data collection allows teachers to monitor student progress and adjust the
curriculum accordingly. K-12 teachers often do not have the time to create the
tools necessary for proper data collection. This repository is the codebase for
a series of programatically generated assessments designed with long-term data
collection in mind. The goal is to make the process of data collection as easy
as possible, increasing the probability that teachers will be able to implement
these strategies. 

# Assessments in this Collection

## CVC Words

The ability to read consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) words is an early reading
skill. We generate 20 random samples of 20 words each from a large list of
common CVC words. Each sample of 20 contains four words containing each short
vowel sound. The sample size of 20 allows for quick mental calculation of the
accuracy as a percentage, and a data table and blank graph are provided for
tracking accuracy over time. For each sample, a student copy and a teacher copy
of the assessment are generated. The student copy could be reused for each
student, or given to the student to keep, while the teacher copy retains the
date and accuracy information.

## CCVC Words

As above, but now words begin with a consonant blend. Each sample of 20 
contains 8 blends involving r, 6 involving s, 4 involving l, and 2 involving a
a blend of three consonants.
